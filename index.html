    <h2>Adnan Muradbegović</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings, I am a half-decent C and Go programmer and a Unix nerd. You can check out my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/amuradbegovic">GitHub profile</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Former <i>complete</i> amateur, now in training at <a href="https://etf.unsa.ba">Faculty of Electrical Engineering Sarajevo</a>. I'm aspiring to become a competent software engineer and pursue further education (master's, PhD) after completing my undergrad. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not doing computer stuff, I'm reading something interesting or listening to punk. When I was younger, I learned to play piano  and read sheet music at a music school. My native language is Bosnian but I am also fluent in English and I can speak some German as well.
