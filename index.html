        I am a 19-year-old hobbyist computer programmer and open source enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Informatics. I'm fairly skillful at C and Go programming languages, and currently learning C++. I <em>love</em> Unix, linear algebra and boolean logic!  
        </p>
        <p>
        After completing my undergraduate degree, I plan to continue studying and hopefully find work at a lab or in a company's R&amp;D department. My dream is to conduct research that, even in small ways, advances the field of computing.

        Besides computer stuff, I'm interested in music, history, politics and literature. I write short poems and can play the piano. I try to follow my city's alternative music and arts scene whenever I have the time for it.

        I'm a native speaker of Bosnian and fluent in English. I can speak some German as well.
