        Hey everyone, I'm a 20 years old hobbyist programmer and lover of all things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
        After completing my Bachelor's degree, I plan to go to grad school and, with my research work, hopefully make a humble contribution the field of computing.         
        </p>
        <p>
        As for my technical skills, I can comfortably code in C, C++ and Go. Currently learning about relational databases and Java. I'm very fond of Unix-like operating systems and I use Linux on a daily basis. I'm a decent mathematician, too, with a keen interest in logic and linear algebra. 
        </p>

        Besides computer stuff, I'm interested in music and various bits and pieces of humanities (especially history, linguistics and politics). I used to play music but now I stick to writing poems. I try to follow my city's alternative rock scene whenever I have the time for it.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm a native speaker of Bosnian and fluent in English. My German is rusty, for now :)
